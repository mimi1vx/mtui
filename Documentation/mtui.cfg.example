# interface_version defines which functionality you want to enable.
# Since mtui can be used to run scripts and to help with transition to
# and polishing of new features, this can be set to a version that has
# not been yet released which will enable features that are planned to
# be stabilized in that (or lower but still future) version.
#
# The format is::
#
#     MAJOR "." MINOR
#
# See ChangeLog.rst for available API versions.
